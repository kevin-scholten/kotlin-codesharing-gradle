# Kotlin JS/JVM Code sharing Gradle multiplatform

## This application contains:
- React Kotlin/JS Front-end
- KTor Jetty Back-end

The template already present shows a Werknemer (Employee) name at the front-end. This name is received from the back-end by an API call. The `Werknemer` data class is shared between front-end and back-end modules.
