# Kotlin JS/JVM Code sharing Gradle multiplatform

## This application contains:
- React Kotlin/JS Front-end
- KTor Jetty Back-end

The template already present shows a Werknemer (Employee) name at the front-end. This name is received from the back-end by an API call. The `Werknemer` data class is shared between front-end and back-end modules.

## Starting the applications
1. Run 'gradle run' to start the back-end.
2. Run 'gradle frontendBrowserDevelopmentRun' to start the front-end.
3. go to `localhost:8080` for front-end, `localhost:3000/api/werknemer` for back-end calls.
